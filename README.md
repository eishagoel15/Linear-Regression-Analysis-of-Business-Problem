# Linear-Regression-Analysis-of-Business-Problem

This repository contains the 'Linear Regression Analysis of Business Problem Project' made by me.

In this project I identified the business problem whose Dataset is given below and then create a linear regression model in Python and analysing its result.

STEP-1: Download the dataset from the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/171jIxEhN07ZtRi10A9zC3w3OUimosufx/view?usp=sharing

STEP-2: Then doing the Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis.

STEP-3: Then creating the Linear Regression ML Model using jupyter notebook.

You can see the python code for this project in the .ipynb file uploaded in this repo.
